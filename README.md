# Gulp for ReactJS Tutorial

This is a simple tutorial for setting up Gulp for reactJS development. Its meant especailly for people who are new to gulp, and react... 

Each step of the setup is listed in its own folder, so you can see how the project is built step by step. I think that is a better way that just showing you a complete and final setup. In this way you will better understand what each step does and how all the components work together.
